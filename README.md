# Pin-Guesser
A brute-force algorithm that can determine a numeric pin of base-10 digits with a known length. The JS file contains a function to randomly generate a pin for the algorithm to determine. The algorithm also calculates the time taken to guess the pin.

The algorithm iterates through possible pin values until it finds a match. Modern security practices prevent submitting multiple incorrect password attempts in quick succession, but this project serves to demonstrate how a computer can iterate over thousands of values in an instant.
